Little graphics library (Java version).
Copyright (c) 2014-2016, Arnaud Giersch.

This is a little library based on the Java/Swing framework to write simple
programs with graphics in Java.

It is not designed to write "real" programs, but rather to write toy
programs in beginners programming courses.

See the examples and documentation (in French) for details.
